# nBit_Calc
Programm to calculate simple SINGLE operator terms (1+1; maxint\*2; etc) without CPU-Register limitations.
Reals are ~~blizzard soon (tm)~~ implemented ~~...~~ !
# *Currently working*:
  - Addition: 
    - Ints and real numbers (',' as decimal point) 
    - calculations above/below 64bit-Signed-Int limit
    - **Test successful!**
  - Subtraction:
    - Ints and real numbers (',' as decimal point)
    - calculations above/below 64bit-Signed-Int limit
    - **Test successful!**
  - Multiplication:
    - Ints and real numbers (',' as decimal point)
    - calculations above/below 64bit-Signed-Int limit
    - **NOT YET TESTED**
  - Division:
    - Ints and real numbers(',' as decimal point)
    - calculations above/below 64bit-Signed-Int limit
